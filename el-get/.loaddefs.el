Hide or show comments from START to END.
Interactively, hide comments, or show them if you use a prefix arg.
\(This is thus *NOT* a toggle command.)

If option `hide-whitespace-before-comment-flag' is non-nil, then hide
also any whitespace preceding a comment.

Interactively, START and END default to the region limits, if active.
Otherwise, including non-interactively, they default to `point-min'
and `point-max'.

Uses `save-excursion', restoring point.

Option `show-invisible-comments-shows-all':

* If non-nil then using this command to show invisible text shows
  *ALL* such text, regardless of how it was hidden.  IOW, it does not
  just show invisible text that you previously hid using this command.

* If nil (the default value) then using this command to show invisible
  text makes visible only such text that was previously hidden by this
  command.  (More precisely, it makes visible only text whose
  `invisible' property has value `hide-comment'.)

From Lisp, a HIDE/SHOW value of `hide' hides comments.  Other values
show them.

This command does nothing in Emacs versions prior to Emacs 21, because
it needs `comment-search-forward'.

Toggle undo-tree mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A positive prefix argument turns the mode on.
A negative prefix argument turns it off.

Undo-tree-mode replaces Emacs' standard undo feature with a more
powerful yet easier to use version, that treats the undo history
as what it is: a tree.

The following keys are available in `undo-tree-mode':

  \\{undo-tree-map}
